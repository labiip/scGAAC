# scGAAC
We propose a novel attention-based graph-convolutional autoencoder, named scGAAC, designed for single-cell clustering. This approach calculates structural relationships among cells through a graph-attention self-encoder, capturing potential associations. Simultaneously, the self-encoder extracts individual cell representation information. The integration of these two sets of information is achieved through an attention fusion module, and their unification is guided by a self-supervised module, contributing to the clustering task. scGAAC represents a hypothesis-free framework. Extensive experimental results on four real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scGAAC surpasses existing methods in terms of clustering accuracy.
